*r001.hpc2* default

*r002.hpc2* delete propagat.inc

*r003.hpc2* propagat.inc uses Binary-Search

*r004.hpc2* delete some useless code

*r005.hpc2* modify mean1.inc, cos(j) -> cos_th(j)

*r006.hpc2* modify propagat.inc, take out some calculations from a loop

*r007.hpc2* pre-processing some calculations in mean1.inc, mean2.inc, propagat.inc. This makes accuracy loss.
